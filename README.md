   - Go to [https://huggingface.co/join](https://huggingface.co/join) and sign up.

2. **Generate an Access Token**
   - Visit [https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens)
   - Click **New token**, give it a name, and select **Read** permission.
   - Copy the token.

3. **Log in from your terminal**
   ```bash
   huggingface-cli login


```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Usage Limitations

This app is optimized for lightweight resumes (1‚Äì2 pages, simple formatting).

Please avoid uploading heavy or overly designed resumes (e.g. CVs with lots of tables, graphics, or 5+ pages).

Large files may lead to long processing times or incomplete AI corrections due to model token limitations.

PDF files should contain real text (not just scanned images) ‚Äî scanned resumes won't work.

---

## üß† Why It Matters

Models like Gemma 2B and others on Hugging Face have context length limits (usually 1024 tokens or less).

Longer resumes get truncated or cause the model to fail or "echo" back the prompt.

Heavy DOCX/PDF resumes with complex formatting may extract poorly, producing messy or unreadable AI results.
